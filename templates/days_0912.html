	This one was probably the first very important step we took together, meeting each other's family. 
</p>
		<p>I'll include the time when you met my family too, because it was shortly before, but the title refers to our time at Vera's with your Mom and Juergen.</p>
		
<div class="divider"></div>



<p>	
    	I was very proud to introduce you to my family. Sort of like "Look how amazing she is". Sure, there was a big language barrier between you and my family but I already could see how everyone instantly liked you. Despite mamie not speaking a word of english and you not a lot of french at the time, you bonded so easily, as if she saw how similar you were to her and vice versa. 
Also, I remember how excited my sisters were to meet you, especially Lulu who just wanted an excuse to speak in english! But most importantly, I loved that moment with my mom were you both got emotional when we were saying goodbye. This really touched me because I know how my mom can be guarding her emotions behind a thick wall but she seemed to have never gotten her guard up around you. She instantly loved and accepted you. I remember how she kept on bragging about how nice you were at my dad's retirement party with her friends. Telling them that we're about to get married and that you were the sweetest. Really big contrast to you-know-who. 
</p>



<p>
	Shortly after you meeting my family, we drove all the way to Windeck to visit your mom and Juergen at Vera's. And god knows I was a bit nervous. Not only to meet your mom, but also Juergen. I really didn't know what to expect but as soon as we arrived, I felt how your mom instantly liked me too, when she hugged me. I could clearly see that your mom wasn't the type to like everyone and let her guard down in front of everyone, but it seemed like she was comfortable enough around me. 
I remember how funny it was for me to catch on you two bitching about Juergen's sister in Pangasinan. 
I was also relieved that Juergen really seems to be on the same software as papy. A very simple guy who just likes food above anything else. And so, I feel like I already won a small place in his heart with the cheese we brought. To this day, I don't really know if he likes anyone except Dharma in your whole extended family, including us, but he seems to be comfortable around us and, as long as we provide nice food, we're on his good side. 
</p>



<p>
I loved our time at Vera's, picking apple and making compote. I really could see how life would be if we were living with your mom, how we could let go and enjoy nice food and tea time. Now, with the time I've spent in the Philippines around you and your mom, I can safely say that I'm happy your mom feels comfortable around me to the point where she can say just about anything. 
It seems like she values my opinion and thinks high enough of me to share her thoughts and plans.
</p>

<p>Now that we are married, we form our own little family, you and I. But on the days we met each other's family, I'm confident in saying that we both extended our family. I know that no matter what happens to me, my family will be there for you.</p>
