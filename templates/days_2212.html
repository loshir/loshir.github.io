	It's very hard to think about these things. To ponder about someone's most precious being's fragility. But after all, we're humans and we are, by essence, quite fragile.
<br>As much as I wish we could live forever, together, I also think that that fear of losing you is a beautiful manifestation of my love and need for you.
</p>



<p>
When I heard the loud noise of you falling down the stairs, it sent shivers down my spine and when I rushed to you and found you there, so scared and crying, it broke my heart. It first broke my heart to see you, my pure, so sweet and innocent petit wife being hurt. Out of all people, you least deserve that. But then it hit me, that second feeling. That dreadful question of "what if she fell a little differently and her head hit the wall of the floor differently..." and I instantly got that rush of fear in me. Followed by relief because you were alright, all things considered, your petit foot still broken.
<br>But it was such a weird roller coaster of emotions. Heart broken, fear, relief, and after all what was left was that fear. It opened up something in me that day. Something I wished stayed close for a long time because I didn't understand the importance of it.
<br>It opened up the door for me to see that I just cannot live without you. That I absolutely would struggle to survive if you were not here with me.
</p>

<p>
I feel so bizarre about this fact because I always said that, prior to meeting each other, we didn't need each other. We completed one another. And so, with that, one might think that we could just revert to whatever it was before meeting each other. But it's not working like that, sadly. 
<br>Because how can you go back to eating melted down, unflavored ice cream when you've tasted the best vanilla ice creamn, freshly made with the best vanilla and cream at the perfect temperature. Once you know how good it feels like to be in that loving relationship, you cannot imagine spending one single day out of it.
<br>I feel bizarre about that fact/feeling because it's scary and reassuring at the same time. It's scary for the simple fact that it brings me back to our mortality, to our fragility. And I want to protect you, and us, at all cost. We should remain healthy and well taken care of so that we can still take care of each other.
<br>But at the same time it's reassuring because it is the purest, most tangible form of love one can feel. It is the very manifestation of our mind and bodies that they are bound to each other. It is uncontrollable and beautiful. We need each other. We cannot without each other. 
</p>

<p class="subtle-italic">And so, I do not want anymore flying yogurt. Let's stay in bed together, safe and sound.
