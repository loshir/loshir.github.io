        I decided to begin with disclosing this thing that I supposedly forgot but remembered.
        The thing I wanted to tell you if we had vows told to each other. I now realize as I'm
        writing this that it's a bit odd considering it's probably all things we've already discussed.
        </p>

        <p>
        It was about you asking me one (or more...) time if there was a moment where I knew. My answer
        was that there is none but upon thinking more, I realized that there are multiple instances
        where I knew. Moments where I just thought to myself “Well this is it. Whatever you thought
        love was, this is it now.”
        </p>

        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <img src="/static/images/boat.jpg" alt="boat">
            <p class="image-caption">Alors, on y ?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
        The first time was that moment where I took a screenshot after telling you that you looked “so
        beautiful.” It was very early in us being together but it felt different than if I just found
        you pretty. It's as if in saying that you were so beautiful, you were reflecting the life we
        had ahead of us and I was already loving it.
        </p>

        <p>
        The second moment was when we were both working from home and I realized that we were both
        doing the same thing of making weird noises or whistling when working. I was struck by how
        similar we were and it confirmed how strongly I already felt for you.
        </p>

        <p>
        The third “moment” was your laugh. I've told you many times before, but one thing that made me
        fall for you was your laugh. I instantly had a way of often making you laugh. When I would
        succeed, your face lit up in such a bright way and that image will always stay with me. This is
        the person I fell in love with. The bright Tazzie.
        </p>

        <p>
        The most important one though was when we spent our first day physically together. I won't go
        too much into detail here because I will cover that event in another day, but that was the
        confirmation of everything. Such a strong affirmation that this is it. It's you. No one else.
        The way our body language instantly took the relay of our on-the-phone conversations in such a
        natural, effortless way. The way we looked at each other. The way we could not
        keep our hands to ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of all the important “this is it” moments, this one is crucial.
        </p>

        <p>
        I know that you like to place a moment to visualize the scene and relive it. Therefore, it was
        important for me to start with the description of these moments where I fell for you.
        </p>
