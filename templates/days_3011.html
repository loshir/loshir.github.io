        What a night. You had planned everything, until the moment where we would have that spicy end!
        </p>

        <p>
I'm sure most people would find it dumb, to have an "online date" like that, cooking together, even having wine and sitting down to pretend that we actually are on a date. But to me it was so romantic.
One of the most romantic things I've ever had the chance to see or live. And again, as I will often say when describing things that we did or say, I love how it was effortless. None of us had to convince the other that it was a good idea. It just clicked.
    <br>_ "Hey let's have a date!"
    <br>_ "Yeah! We can prepare it on video call and have some wine"
<br> The idea bounced on each other and became such a complete romantic experience. 
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
 I love how we began to look at each other in a new light (now you have the song in your head). I love how you allowed me to stare at you to admire your face and your body. I actually didn’t even realize back then how I was looking at you, sort of undressing you with my eyes, until you told me.
 I love how we opened up even more during that night, with you telling me about what happened in 2016. You let me in your petit heart, and I remember thinking to myself that night that all I want is to help you, protect you, cherish you. For to me, you are the most precious being and you deserve to only know happiness and love. And to think that we were not even really together despite being already dangerously close.  
        </p>

Looking closely at how things are nowadays, we still have that kind of dates quite often. I would cook pasta for you, pizza for me and we would have it together in our petit room. But I'm always taken back to that first date whenever we go to a restaurant. 
For example, I remember our date in 3 brasseurs, where we seemed to have been the only couple who's enjoying their time. We were talking a lot, laughing, just like that first night together.
        </p>
                <div class="end-gif-wrapper">
            <img src="/static/images/pasta.jpg" alt="pasta">
            <p class="image-caption">I always love to cook pasta for you.
            </p>
        </div>

                <p>
   Funnily enough, that first date was also the day we had our first sexual experience together and despite feeling quite shy about it at first, it, again, felt so natural and effortless. After the few first minutes lost in my overthinking process "what are we doing?... Is it not cringe what I'm saying?... Will she like if I say this?..." I just abandoned myself to the moment, and if I remember correctly, it also was the night when I told you "I love you" for the first time during that sexual experience.  
        </p>

                <p>
    I'd like to discuss about this first date with you today whenever we are on the phone, I'm curious to know what your recollection of the even is and if there are hidden details to remember. I want to keep this memory as full and intact as possible to cherish it forever.
