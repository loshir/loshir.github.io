 I can't believe that we are already closing in on our 4th year of knowing each other.. We met in 2022 and we are already in 2026. I can't believe how fast time flies and how everything bad that ever happened to each of us is now a long distant memory. In reality, it's always sort of bitter sweet when a year ends because you're happy to be surrounded by the people you love and to have another year with them, you're happy about what you've achieved and all, but you're also quite bitter about how time seems to just fly before you.
<br>Surely, I don't plan on making a dissertation about time, but I think it is quite interesting to see how it just dissapear from our hands without us having any hability to ever catch it. Whatever we want to do, no matter how much we want to slow down, the train -as John Mayer would say- cannot be stopped. Even in the sweet, lazy moments we can have at home, where the day should feel slower, time just flies and by the time we're looking at our phones to see what time is is, it's already about time to go to bed for me to work the next day.

<p>
I am so proud of all the years we've already spent together and of what we were able to do. We managed to get married in less than a year, than bring me there for 6 months and established a plan for us to finally have the tranquille life we want to achieve. And since then, we've paid almost all your cards and we'll soon start with my bank and soon enough, we'll be free of these debt with a large amount of money on the side for us to fuck off to the Philippines whenever we want.
<br>I want to say that my main focus with this upcoming year is to stay on track for everything we want to build or fix. I want to stay focused on paying back our debt and trying my best to lose weight to feel better in my body.
</p>

<p>But since a couple of days, we've discovered something that could also be one of my personal goal and, I still don't know if it's worth pursuing it as a course, if it's even possible with how the system is en France, but I want to try to pursue my interest in Philosophy and especially Metaphysics as it seems to be the topic I am naturally attracted to. It will be hard for me because it'll take some rewiring of my brain to not be wanting to stop reading to go watch some youtube or a tv show. I think I need to have a deep ceisure from that world where entertainment is easy and rewarding. Sure enough, I also watch a lot of interesting thing that teaches me some stuff here and there, but it's not the main sort of content. 
<br>I don't know how I'll be able to do it, but it'll take a lot of self discipline which I think might be difficult to enforce. I know that when I was a kid, I liked to read because it was entertaining to me. I'd like to get back to that state of mind, reconnect with what made me the smart kid with a potential that I didn't reach because of distractions like video games, youtube or tv shows. I don't mean anything grand by it, just trying to find whatever is my "thing" and actually spend time doing said thing instead of wandering around, with my sole purpose in life being your husband.
<br>As much as I love having that as my priority, because being your husband will always be the priority, I felt that, when you're not here, I have nothing going on for me basically. While you're there painting or spending time with your aunts, belle and your mom, I am here, basically rotting until you come back. If I had developped my interest and brain for my "thing" I could just do that to keep myself busy and not feel so bad. Sort of how I was telling you that you need friends in life because I can't possibly substitute for everything a friend can be (like I can provide Rover's drama instead of Aly). </p>

<p>I'm happy that we spent such an interesting year, and I want 2026 and 2027 to be the years during which we both focus on our passions as well as each other. We should find deep happiness in our little bubble with our passions and each other being excited for the other.</p>

<p class="subtle-italic">Ps : I feel like if we had a new year's celebration it would be like in the title picture.</p>
