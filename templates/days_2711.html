        Bubble is such a simplistic childish word. I don't even like the way it sounds really "bubbbb". But despite these primary defects, for lack of a better word describing how it felt, bubble will have to do.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our love materializing into an unbreakable barrier between us and the rest of the world with only a small hermetic door for when one of us has to go out or to work.

        I remember the first weeks / months talking to each other, discovering each other. And it felt like we were alone on earth. I was barely speaking to anyone else, spending all of my time talking to you. We spent sleepless night on the phone before going to work where I would continue texting you. 
	    Falling in love with you felt like suddenly I had something to do, a purpose. My mind being already too busy with the thought of you that everything else was done on autopilot, without thinking about it. 
	    I discovered how sweet life was, I began enjoying walking around, the wind on my skin as if it were your touch. I remember laughing a lot more, even with other people or my family. Food tasted better, music sounded clearer, the weather always sunny. After all, how could there be clouds and rain in a bubble.

    I remember comparing the situation to a movie because it really felt like it was a written story. Something already scripted, for it to be so perfect. 
	Do you remember what I told you about the movie "Your Name"? I said that the first time I saw it, it made me incredibly sad because I never felt what they are portraying. And it had a big impact on me. When we saw it after meeting each other, it did not have the same effect because I already felt what they are portraying with you. 
	Just like in movies, whatever we'll talk about, we'll agree on. Just like in movies, whatever challenge comes our way, it's erased so fast.
    To the point where your mom even met some german guy 10 years prior to us meeting, just so that you'd be able to stay long enough when you visit me.
	I remember how clear it was to me that this was it. Her or no one. This or nothing.
	And in our bubble, life sped through so fast that we were already in Dusseldorf meeting each other.

        I wonder how you experienced it? If for you it also was something as encapsulating as it was for me?

            Also, have you noticed that in all the Peach and Goma pictures and gifs it’s only them. There is never another character or even animals. It’s like they are alone in their own world. And maybe it’s also another reason why we can relate to them so much. 
            They are in their own little bubble.</p>
