        This one is a bit of an easy one. I have to admit that, as easy as it is to pick this for the subject of today, it is something
    that was inevitably going to come out. 
</p>

<p>
I know that I've already mentioned it in the "This is it moments" entry, but I thought I ought (impossible to pronounce btw) to make
    sure I cover this extensively, for it is not just your laugh that is to compliment. 
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>	
    You already know now that your laugh made me fall right away. As soon as we were consistently video calling, I would admire your face
    light up every time I managed to make you laugh. And the sight is more beautiful than anything I've seen. 
    It's the way your head pulls back while your eyes are closing. And your mouth opens just enough for me to see your beautiful smile.
    Your entire face completely lights up. 
    It's the way that it sounds loud and light at the same time. Just like a caress for my ears, or my brain, telling it "good job for making me laugh, here is your reward".
</p>

<div class="end-gif-wrapper">
    <img src="/static/images/peachlaugh.gif" alt="peach">
    <p class="image-caption">
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    But it is also the way that it comes out so easily. Selfishly, I love the way it makes me feel. I love being empowered and complimented 
    by your laugh. Whenever I hear it, I just feel like the happiest and funniest person on earth. 
    Selfishly, I don't care if we laugh out loud when we are in public. I want people to hear how happy you are, how much I enjoy your company, 
    and how much you enjoy mine. 
</p>

<p>
    Your laugh, and the way it illuminates your face, is the cure for my low self-esteem. Although I am aware that I might be funny at times, 
    nothing will make me feel like the funniest guy in any room more than your laugh. Your laugh makes me feel like I am loved, appreciated, like someone actually enjoys my company.
    It also plays a major part in showing how good our relationship actually is. We enjoy each other's company genuinely. We are each other's best friend. 
    And what do best friends do together? They laugh.
