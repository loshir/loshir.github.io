This entry is a little bit special, not easy to write.
</p>

<p>
It would be so easy to just chat for hours about how kind you are to me, how caring you are. It would be easy to describe how your sweet embrace makes me feel.But all of this cannot accurately describe why I like your sweetness so much.
Instead, I'd like to look at the spectrum of your sweetness in the many ways you can move me, in the many ways you can touch my heart.
</p>

    One of the first instances of that was when you described to me how you felt when I was telling you about my shoes getting a bit damaged from the washing machine when we met. Your first reaction was to look for a new pair for me instantly. For you, it is natural to provide what I would be lacking.And in that regard, you are providing everything I was lacking in a relationship. All the little things I wished for in my past relationship, you provide so naturally, effortlessly.All of these things touch my heart because, for some of the things, I had given up on having. It particularly touches my heart when you caress me out of the blue, kiss me casually. I love every sign of affection, but this sweetness of touch is moving; it is like giving yourself up, forgetting yourself for a moment. And in that moment, you get to not think about any problem you might have.
</p>

    <p class="image-caption"> I also find it so sweet when you fall asleep on your petit phone like this...
    </p>
</div>

<p>
You move me when you tell me about how you feel in certain situations, because it always takes me back to little Tazi, because a lot of things you get to experience through her eyes, or at least with eyes heavily impacted by her past. It moves me to know how fragile and sweet your heart is. In that sense, your sweetness is quite related to your vulnerability, but it is also impressive that you get to be so selfless despite having had bad experiences in the past.It moves me, the way you can forget about yourself to sacrifice for others, particularly me. Although it is not something I want in most cases, because I would never want for us to have to sacrifice something for the other, it moves me when you think about giving me some petit snack or food despite liking it, just because you know I do too.
</p>

<p>
Your sweetness is not just kindness, it is also your empathy, especially towards me. It is the way you can understand my feelings effortlessly, the way I can simply be an open book and know that I will not be judged by what is written on the page, but rather helped to turn the next one and move on.Your sweetness is also physical. It is incredibly satisfying, when we touch, to feel how soft and delicate your skin is. You are sweet, dainty, delicate, and I can never have enough of being lost in your sweet embrace.
