I have a problem with the term "soul mate". People tend to use it too often, describing just about anything. Sort of how some people think that their relationship has depth or strength. 
</p>

<p>
I think when it comes to our relationship, I tend to have this feeling of reject for other's. I don't like the idea that they might think that they have what we have, that they are feeling what we are feeling. It's probably a toxic way of viewing it, but it can easily be explained by how we are, by definition, soul mate. 
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>	
    For me, even before we met, I define a soul mate as someone with who it just clicks, effortlessly. With who, it is so easy to fall in love, with this feeling of everything suddenly making sense. Each person, despite not being perfect objectively, would be for the other. 
	Therefore, I think that by definition, we are soul mates. Sure enough, we had a moment during which I had to wait a little because I fell before you, but I know you were just being cautious.

    </p>

<p>
I still have a hard time realizing how it seemed to have been destined. I do believe in some sort of a butterfly effect, one small thing can be the start of a chain to cause a very impactful event, and if we go way back, everything makes sense. 
I think it began by the loss of your dad and your mom needing to find someone else. She had options, she was talking to several men but the one who she married was this german guy. Then, for years and years, you had to endure this shitty penpal relationship, as if you were waiting for me, making sure not to meet anyone else that could disrupt the timing. Meanwhile, I endured years with this person, only for us to be available at the exact same time. If during any of these years, the smallest thing changed, we probably wouldn't have met. We were available and ready to meet real love, at the same time, hardened by our past shitty relationships. And finally, the payback from your mom marrying this german guy, made it possible for us to meet in real life long enough for me to propose to you. 
</p>

<p>
Surely, I don't necessarily believe in god, nor a higher power, but I have to admit that we got lucky.
	You are my soul mate because I don't want to spend time without you, because as well as being my wife, you are my best friend. We are bond beyond this physical world and, by some etheral forces, we joined again. Now, all that I'm wishing for is to be lucky enough to spend a long and healthy life by your side. Just enjoying the sweet, tranquille life I have, with the soul I yearned to rejoin through hard years and desperate times.
