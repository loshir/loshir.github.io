	I don't know why (well I do, I just can't tell you why ahah) I just thought of when we had to prepare for leaving for 6 months in the Philippines.
</p>
		
<div class="divider"></div>


<p>
	I remember feeling so excited. A big part of me was relieved to leave work and to finally spend some time not doing anything, not really having any responsabilities. My only goal each day would be to just relax and enjoy the time I have.
<br>But at the same time, I also felt unsure about what would come next. At the time, we didn't even know if we would come back at all. Staying there was still on the table and we simply didn't know what life had in store for us in the future and what would be our plans. We gave back the appartment, sold the car, perfectly ready to leave it all behind.
<br>During this process of letting go of everything, I felt a sense of relief too. It was so satisfying to untie myself from the responsability of the car, of the appartment, of internet subscription, selling everything we had that couldn't be stored at Vera's. It was so liberating, perhaps one step into the minimalist mind that we're trying to cultivate these past months. Understanding that less is better.
</p>



<p>
One thing I can say for sure is that I wasn't scared or anxious. Just like with everything else that we do together, I don't feel scared, I just feel excited to see what's to come; for I know that whatever we'll face, it'll be together. (I don't know if I used the ";" correctly but I'm experimenting with my writing.)
<br>I was also excited to discover the Philippines. To see where my petit wife is from and explore where you grew up. I could only imagine the places in which you've grown and lived before me and also where we met. Most importantly, I really was excited to meet your whole family. As I didn't know any of them except your mom and Juergen, it was important for me to meet them and feel that we're all part of one big family.
</p>

<p>
I chose to title today's entry "The great escape" because of this song, you can play it to see which I'm talking about. It always brought me this feeling of lightness, as if I was ready to go. Where, I don't know. But at least I felt light.
<br>And so, when we planned for that sabbatical, this is exactly how I felt. So light. I can't express how much I miss that feeling, especially when everything here feels 10 times heavier when you're not around. Work is exhausting, Noël is stressing me out because I feel like I have nothing to bring.
<br>Sometimes though, we don't even need to plan a sabbatical or go anywhere for me to feel light. Just your hand in the back of my head, or your lips on mine will make me float like a feather. 
</p>

<p class="subtle-italic">I wonder what was your state of mind when we were preparing to go there? Were you anxious about me liking/not liking it there? Were you just as excited as I was?</p>
