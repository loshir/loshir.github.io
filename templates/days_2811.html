        Today is inspired by this song that I have recently discovered. I like the sentence that is the title for today. With yesterday's text, I described to you how it felt falling in love with you and I must say that it never stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some might say that they miss how it felt falling in love with their partner because their "magic" or "fire" is gone. But I don't think we could say the same.
	    It somehow still feels like we are in our bubble, together, at home. And every moment we spend together is filled with romance. 
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
    What we are doing right now, writing letters to each other, preparing surprises, some might just do that the first time they see each other, and then the magic is gone. But it seems like it will be a life-long thing. I just love preparing surprises for you, picking up little surprise snacks at the groceries for you, or flowers.
	I love preparing your breakfast every morning and bringing it to you in bed.
	Our daily life is filled with romantic moments, even more romantic than what people perceive as romantic. For some it would be grand gestures like writing your name in the sky.
	For me, it's about consistantly expressing my love for you by bringing you your tea, exactly the way you like it, every morning.
        </p>

        <p>
    It always feels like we're falling in love because our love keeps growing, renews, and stays young. We are finding new ways to love each other and to show it. We are relentlessly expressing it. And therefore, it never feels like the fire died down. If anything, the fire is starting to burn everything around it and the pacíon only grows bigger. 
	I remember us imaging the falling with a flower, and then a field of flowers, the grounds of this prairie is quite fertile because it keeps on sprouting new flowers, and even when the first flowers fade out, just as nature intended for them to go, new stronger ones grow on that soil. 
	Funny how my greatest achievment in life had nothing to do with any skills. It simply was falling in love with you.

            This reminds me of our time in Giverny. How sweet it felt to fall even more for you there, in such a beautiful context. We should go back.
