	Sadly, despite us loving the little bubble we were in during the first days / weeks, I had to go back to work at some point.

<p>	
    	But then, I would say that these days also gave you a glimpse into how it would be if we lived together. You'd be at home, sometimes working remotly, while I was be at the office. 
Weirdly enough, I feel like this was quite a natural process for us to go through, it didn't disrupt our dynamic and we kept on evolving around it. Just like anything else, it seems like our boat, whatever storm it might be stuck in or no matter the ocean we're navigating, stays afloat. Nothing seems to disrupt our tranquility and we adapt to anything, making it part of our daily routine. 
And so, it became quite normal for you to cook a bit more, to take on more responsability in the house while I was working.
</p>



<p>
	I remember you telling about how didier would stay in his tower, staring at you from behind the barrier. He must have felt weird too. Wondering why would I leave you two alone and why wasn't he allowed in the room anymore. Just like my family though, Didier seemed to have welcomed you easily. I think that, in general, pets love you and that's a major green flag. I remember one time when I brought didier to the park with my friends and he really did not like one of Océane's friend. He was barking and growling at her. Maybe he knew that she wasn't a good person. 
With you though, he felt comfortable right away and he probably found a weird companion. He is an odd dog and I feel like he understood that we were odd people too.
</p>



<p>
I also remember that our conversations didn't stop even when I was at work. We would keep on texting, sending each other pictures, and it remains to this day. Sure enough, we are often waiting to be back together at home to have full on conversations, but we keep on texting, giving each other news, and it is easily explained by how inseparable we are. 
Put us in two different countries, on the other side of the world, and we'll be glued to our phones, wanting to get the latest news about the other person.
</p>

<p>I loved how this was the beginning of our little routine, the one I find so sweet and romantic. The one that people would think kills a relationship, when I view it as a way for us to love each other more, a way for us to deepen the affection for one another. </p>
