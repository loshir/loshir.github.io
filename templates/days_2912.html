	Today I want to be thankful.

<div class="divider"></div>


<p>
 I want to thank whatever combination of nature and nuture that made you who you are. I have never someone with such a pure heart, a pure love to give. I know it is well hidden and that you actually tend to be very very careful with others and even tend to show the opposite of that pure heart by default, but with me, you are pure love. Someone I have never thought I could dream of having. I didn't know someone could trigger in me such an urge to fix everything for them, protect them and give my absolute everything for their happiness. 
</p>



<p>
I want to be thankful for you taking the chance with me back when we started talking to each other. I know there were a lot of setbacks and even I thought about giving it all up by fear of getting heartbroken. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me well enough to know my intentions with you were only love and to open up slowly to reveal that pure love self that I've come to love. I think taking the time to get to know me was necessary in order to come to love me fully, even physically. With time, we even transformed the love we have for each other's souls into a raw physical appearence that can make me confidently say that you are the most attractive woman I've seen. I just want you, every day, all the time, everywhere. And that came not only from your cute face and laugh but also because of how we took the time to discover each other well enough to let that love make the physical attraction impossible to avoid.
</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to thank you for loving me the way you do. I don't think I could have ever hoped to have such a loving partner in life. You give me everything I need, all the time and I feel like it's often more than what anyone deserves. Your love expresses in such a pure way. The way you would worry about me, even for the smallest things. The way you take so much time and put so much efforts into gifts or little things for me. The way you want to add tiny little loving details into our lives like the "Taxi" imbroided into my jacket or the "mal à tête" written on the pills. It's that kind of pure, unintentionnaly cute gestures that make me fall for you more and more. These things make me realize how precious you are and how precious your love is. No one could ever dream about receiving such love because I'm not even sure they know it exists. What I have the chance to live with you might not even have been properly written in love stories before. I have never seen anyone give and receive such a pure love before. Thank you for giving it to me and making me the happiest, luckiest man.</p>
