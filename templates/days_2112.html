	I wanted to talk about the time in the Philippines for the last entry of this week. 
</p>
		
<div class="divider"></div>


<p>
	I can definitely say that there, I felt the real bubble. It reminded me of the first few weeks together. I think when we were there, I felt the lightest I've felt in probably a decade. I had no responsabilties with work, we had money with the saving up thing unlocked, we didn't have a worry in the world. This is why I wanted to go back to that head space today.
<br>While some people might think that we only want to go there because of the nice beaches or the weather, we actually are after tranquility. I think that wherever we can live without needing to go out often and just be at home, enjoying each other's company, would be the perfect place for us. In a way, we sort of were living like some of these japanese people there. We seldom went out, only when we needed to. We had groceries delivered most of the time, meals delivered, shopee... I didn't mind just going out when we would travel actually. This was pretty simple and enjoyable to me.
</p>



<p>
This bubble.2 will always have a special place in my heart. It allowed me to focus on our goal of today which is paying back our debt and saving up as much money as possible to be able to live wherever we want. I think it gave me a second wind with Axione too. Allowing me to change position and have a much more tranquille and easy job.
<br>Most importantly, this bubble allowed me to truly discover what it felt like living there and meet with your entire family. I got to see the world through your eyes for a little bit and that will always be special to me.
<br>I will always remember how special it was to visit your mom's place and see all the pictures of little Tazi and see how angry she always looks in the pictures, except when she was just a baby. I often wish I could go back and put a smile on her face by telling her that she's very cute and special.
</p>

<p>
And so, I wanted to thank you in particular. Because you made it happen and I think it should be appreciated. I know how hard you worked before my arrival for everything to be perfect for me. I know that you aksed uncle Jun to install this shower head parce que you knew I didn't like this american thingy, I know that you installed these green curtains and the cover on the window so that we wouldn't feel too hot, you even bought an expensive AC for me.
<br>In a way, it really is the reversal of when you arrived in Mons en Baroeul the first time. I bought a lot of things, tried my best to make it perfect for you. And I find it so sweet that we had the same way of preparing for the other. 
</p>

<p class="subtle-italic">Thank you for making my time in the philippines so special ma chérie.
    <br>Ps : I know you're gonna ask, the picture for the title image is on our way to Pagudpud.
