	Today I wanted to talk about the meaning of being married, "on my side".
</p>
		
<div class="divider"></div>


<p>
	I'm pretty sure that for some people, being married is simply about signing a piece of paper and having your taxes counted together. Maybe also sharing a last name.
<br>Maybe for some other people, they'll think that the relationship should change from when you were simply dating. And while I disagree with that, because the relationhip should always be treated as if you were married for it to have love expressed the right way, I will add some nuances to that later.
</p>



<p>
For me, being married has always been the natural continuation of our relationship. Actually, I would say that I always treated you the same, even before we say yes to each other at the mairie. When we were just dating, I was not telling myself "oh this relationship can end so quickly and I can find someone else". I was already in the state of mind that we'll be together forever.
<br>And it brings me to my first nuance for how the relationship kind of changes when you get married. Because, of course, I already knew before getting married to you that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you and that I was certain that I wouldn't want to change anything. It was and will always be you. It was like my little secret. Perhaps a secret that you already knew because of how open we already were with each other. But not something that outsiders would know anything about. Perhaps the toxic thing is that for other people, because they believe the relationship changes when married, will not view our relationship in a scope closer to ours.
<br>I guess my point is that, while the realtionship remains the same for me - you were already my petit wife through my thoughts and actions. It is now known by anyone who'll be observant enough to look at my left hand, or who'll have a long enough conversation with me to drop that I have a wife.
</p>

<p>
I love that, by being husband and wife, we made an unspoken promise. The promise of being sure of one another, to not doubt that we in fact are each other's soul mate. I know that neither of us would have gone through that process without being sure.
<br>I love that we also promised through that act to always make sure the other one is never alone. While we can physically be alone sometimes, when I'm at work, when you're in the Philippines, I never feel alone in my heart. I know that there will always be my special someone to share whatever happened during the day.
<br>I love that, for us, we included without really thinking about it, the promise of being each other's best friend. It is vital to like being around your partner because I know that some couple would probably prefer to spend time with friends than just with their partner. Maybe they'll consider it not as fun. Well, I have the most fun with you.
</p>

<p>Being married to you is the perfect all-rounder feeling. It's certainty in a world where it doesn't exist, it's security when love is a dangerous feeling, it's fun even as a two people party and it's being able to isolate in our own bubble in a crowd of 8 billion people.
<br>I'm proud of us achieving such a fulfilling state of living.</p>
