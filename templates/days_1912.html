	The unexpected happened during our stay there. We became parents.
</p>
		
<div class="divider"></div>


<p>
	We often like to joke that Lily Belle is already enough of a child to us that we don't really "need" to have another one. But in all honesty, she really is our child. We had the chance to welcome her when she would fit in one hand and we saw her grow up to be a rowdy lady who doesn't take Darcy's non-sense of trying to hump her.
<br>I remember how clingy she was right from the beginning. En fait, when we saw her for the first time at your aunts, quite quickly, she started licking my hands as a way to show me that she accepted me. And then, when we brought her home, in the petit room, she adapted pretty fast I think. 
<br>I'm proud that she was able to spend her puppy months in a room with loving people. She surely was well taken care of and well fed (although that never was a problem). 
</p>



<p>
Her personality really is something. She is clingy and loving but also loud and rowdy. She also doesn't really take no for an answer and would bark back at you if you don't give her what she's begging for. 
<br>I would say that she was truly a bright light in our days. Having her around must have made, and still makes, it easier for you to not feel alone in this petit room of ours when I left in december 2023 and now. 
<br>I like the way she always sleeps in weird positions and how she would run to come join the kisses when she hears them.
</p>

<p>
I'll admit that part of me wished we could have stayed there mainly because of her. I really think that when we get to live there, we really should get her back and have her live with us. Sure enough she might be older already, maybe like 4 or 5 but she'll still get to stay for a long time with us. And we can offer her more space if we have our own place.
<br>I was quite sad when I had to leave, both times. I know she doesn't really feel sad about it, being a dog, she probably wonders where I am and looks for me for a couple of days and then accepts that she's with mama now. But it's more for me that I felt sad. Because I don't get to hold her and have her cuddle up next to me.
</p>

<p>All things considered, she made me realize that it would be perfectly okay for us if we did end up being pregnant. This is why I never really got scared-scared when we saw Aby getting late. This experience made me realize that we could definitely do it. It also proved me that we would be good parents. I still think we're better off without, of course, but at least it's not as scary. Thanks to our petit belle.</p>
