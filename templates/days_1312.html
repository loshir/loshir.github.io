	Today we tackle another life changing moment in our relationship. This trip really was a rollercoaster, for all the good reasons.
</p>
		
<p>	
    	I think it was important for me that we visited this region together. I found it so beautiful when I was there but sadly I was in bad company and I wanted to share this beauty with the right person.
To be honest, I did not even have this intent going there, I'm just trying to explain what could have been the reasoning in my head before going there. I remember that, seeing these places back then, was really happy memories despite the company. So it really says something about how much I like it there.
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>


<p>
	And so, we took our car and drove all the way there, our first road trip together. I can safely say that I didn't feel the time pass in the car despite it being a very long drive. We always have fun driving together, singing, talking for hours on end. It's still the case today, whenever we have to drive to my parents, mamie or Aly's, we always have fun rides.
<br>Déjà, I must say that I really liked our airbnb. I loved how somewhat isolated it was and how tranquille the place was. We really were, again, in a little bubble of ours there which is a reccurent theme. I like how simple it was too, just a room with a nice bathroom. Nothing more than what we needed.
</p>



<p>
I remember the trip we took to that lake and how pivital it was for us both. Déjà, for me, I simply got to see that place I like so much again, accompanied by the person who matters most to me in the world.
But for you, I remember how scared you were to walk on these makeshift steps and weird paths. But I also remember how brave you became when holding my hand. I know it wasn't easy for you to do but I think that day, you realized that I will always be here for you, to support and help you through everything you have to face. You understood that you'll never be alone. You have in me a husband and everything you have to face, we face.
I'm proud of you for facing these scary things and I'm sure you are of yourself too. I feel like it really was worth it because we got to have such a nice time at this lake, also with you capturing that moment you love so much with my hands behind my back.
</p>

<p>
But of course, the most important even of Colmar's trip didn't happen in a lake or under the stars but in this petit airbnb. Colmar was the time we made sure we caught up on the physical time we didn't get in Italy. While in Italy we kept having phone sex all the time, in Colmar, we kept having sex in this airbnb to the point where we made the megacum happen.
I feel like that was such a structural moment for us. For you, obviously because you found out you could feel this way when I eat you, but for me it was such a thrill. 
All I ever wanted with sex was to get this kind of reaction. I just absolutely love the fact that I can make you feel like something cosmic was happening. I love how you describe the feeling with your talk about the stars or the world, it's both funny and quite amazing at the same time.
And I think it's what got me so addicted to wanting to make you cum, I just love to replicate that feeling again and again. I think this is the best way to approach sex also. It's so easy for us men to cum and so we should focus on making the woman cum so that we can both enjoy equally.
</p>

<p>Colmar was such a fantastic trip mon amour. I would love to go back at some point and explore. But first, we'll have other places to visit. </p>
