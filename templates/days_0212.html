    Today, we begin this week's series of talking about your qualities. The things that made me and keep making me fall for you.
        </p>

        <p>
	I thought it would be a good fit to begin with your intelligence as it is something that is quite attractive to me. I think it is called sapiosexuality. It
	describes someone who finds intelligence attractive. For me, it really is one of the most important thing because I find it extremely boring to converse with
	someone who lacks intelligence or curiosity for the world. 
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
	When I meet people, could it be when I was younger with my friends in bars, or now at work, whenever I meet new people, it's always the first thing I'm looking for. 
	And sadly, if I see that the person is lacking in that department, I already know that my liking towards them will be limited.
	So, when we met, I was looking for markers of intelligence. 
       </p>

        <p>
	Right away, I noticed how you liked to tackle subjects deeply and seriously. I loved how your points were always interesting and well thought. 
	I remember talking about politics and I remember how good it felt to find someone who had the same point of view as me. Thinking that all of it does not matter 
	because none of these politics are interested in changing anything. 
	I remember being pleasantly surprised by your cunning word play or jokes.
	Very quickly, I knew your mind was interesting and sharp.  
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
	Today, I remain impressed whenever you fix something effortlessly, like with Belle's collar or whenever you need to pack something up for Vinted. I'm also
	very impressed by the way you're able to paint so well. 
	And I think this is were your intelligence, in my opinion, shines the most. Your creativity and your ability to create the most beautiful things with your hands. 
	I've never seen any of your paintings or drawings that would not impress me. I could have never imagined how that project of yours would turn out to be so well orchestrated.
        </p>
                <p>
	Some people might confuse that for "talent" or hand skills but I know that it takes an intelligent mind to do all of this so well. 
	Your intelligence is remarkable mon amour, and it is so attractive.
        </p>
