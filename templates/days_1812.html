	The title is mainly here to give you an earworm. Luckily enough though, it also fits today's entry.

<p>
	Today's entry will be shorter because I needed a "filler" day for today. En fait, I already know what the two next things are, and I can't really talk about something that comes after these two next entries... So I hope you still find it nice to read my thoughts on arriving there!
    <br>I don't know how other people would feel about moving to another country for 6 months and adapting to the lifestyle, not knowing if you'll enjoy it or even if you'll end up staying longer. 
<br>I think the lack of clear plan is also what made it so exciting to me. I came with the idea that anything could happen ("when you take a chance..." -  It's in the song) and so I was open to anything. 
</p>



<p>
When I finally arrived in the Philippines for the first time, I was shocked by the heat. I remember it being the first key moment. When I got out of the plane and I thought the heat I felt was the plane's. You'd have fun being in my head when I realized that this excruciating heat was normal there. I really had a moment of "What the actual fuck" where I thought I would simply die.
<br>I remember feeling a little nervous when I had to go through immigration and everything. It was the first time for me doing these things and I didn't know if they'd be annoying ou quoi. 
</p>

<p>
As it was the first time for me to fly to you and not the other way around, I found out how good it felt to be welcomed by the one you love. And, whatever worry I had with immigration, or how down I could be from the heat, all vanished when I saw you in that white and blue dress.
<br>I think that feeling reminds me of how it feels to come home to you. Whatever anxiety or worry I may have outside, as soon as I push the door of home and see you come to me to kiss and hug, it vanishes away.
<br>And overall, this is the feeling I had when I arrived in the Philippines. I really felt like it was coming home to you.
</p>

<p class="subtle-italic">I didn't know yet all the nice things that would happen there and all the decisions we would take during that trip but I knew I was home with you wherever we are.</p>
