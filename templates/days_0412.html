    I don't even know if that counts as a quality for everyone, but to me, your vulnerability only makes my love for you grow.
        </p>

        <p>
This side of you took a while to be uncovered. Maybe it is your way of trying to shield yourself from harm, or maybe it is just because you were more shy.
	Regardless, I don't really know it started to show but I definitely know that it wasn't there at all in the very beginning.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>I've told you this before, but I think we are sad souls. People who've been through a lot and have known sadness and pain. People who need to be understood and cherished
	to be able to thrive in any kind of relationship. 
	I remember one time, after one of our first visits to charleville mézières, we were talking about some trauma from your past, I don't remember exactly what it was. 
	But I remember that you felt understood and you cried. 
	This was probably one of the earliest moments where I understood the depth of your vulnerability and how important it was to cherish and protect you.
</p>

        <p>
	I keep circle back to that sense of duty towards you, and with me being able to understand you and your vulnerability, the task is even more important.
	Not only as your husband, but also as the one to whom you can confess about every pain, every fear, I cannot fail to the duty of making sure you feel loved and appreciated.
	I have said it before, and i will kep saying it over and over, but to me, that sense of duty, that weight, is positive. I do think that it is important to feel the weight
	of your partner's heart in your hands. It is important to understand the gravity of that responsibility.

I love how you allow yourself to be little Tazi with me. I know she did not have a good time growing up and that she'd prefer to hide in many situations.
	So to know that she feels safe to come out and play fills me with joy. 
	My only hope is that one day, she will be healed enough to experience the wolrd again, without being hurt so much. She is much better than what she was told she was. 
	She is much smarter and much stronger too. She is a vulnerable little soul, with plenty to give. She just needs to know that she is cherished and loved.
